    If I had to choose between travel and money, I would choose travel because travel teaches us important lessons. 
    It educates us about the beauty of nature.

<h3>Twilight</h3>
<p>
    I started reading Twilight sometime last year, and thanks to Edward and Bella, I instantly fell in love with the entire series. Breaking Dawn, my favorite book in the entire series, and the reason I first became a fan. I watched the first Twilight movie when it originally came out and didn't like it. It took me a year or two to finish the series, and when I did, I discovered that they were far superior to the movies. I became a fan of Twilight after reading each of the Tree Time books, lol!
