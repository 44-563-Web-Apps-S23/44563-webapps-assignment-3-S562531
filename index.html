        <h4>FootBall</h4>
        <p>
            <B>Football often acts an escape from our normal life</B>. 
            We may have had a hard week and so the entire week we may look forward to that one weekend game. For those 90 minutes, we forget all our problems and focus on our team's problems.
            <B>A goal scored by our team brings us joy and a goal conceded makes life harder.</B>
            Football teaches cooperation and team work, helps develop positive social skills and teaches respect for others. 
            It helps build self-confidence, a positive self-image and self-worth.
